*DURATION: 4 WEEKS (  15th May 2025 -15thJune 2025)



##Project Overview

The *Online Reservation System* is a console-based application developed using Java. It is designed to simulate a basic reservation system that allows users to perform operations such as booking a ticket, cancelling a reservation, and viewing all existing reservations. The application emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, ensuring that even users with minimal technical knowledge can interact with it easily.

This project was developed as a part of my learning journey and academic task to strengthen core programming concepts, especially in Java. It serves as a fundamental model for real-time reservation systems used in railways, buses, airlines, and other ticketing platforms.

## Features

- *Ticket Reservation*: Users can book a ticket by entering personal and travel details including name, age, gender, source, and destination.
- *Cancellation of Reservation*: Users can cancel their reservation by providing their name.
- *View All Reservations*: Displays a list of all currently booked tickets with full details.
- *Interactive Console UI*: A menu-driven interface that loops until the user chooses to exit.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- *Java*: The core programming language used to build the logic and user interface.
- *Java Collections (ArrayList, Iterator)*: Used for managing and iterating over reservations.
- *Scanner Class*: For reading user input from the console.
- *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)*: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was used for development, with Java extensions for support.
- *JDK (Java Development Kit)*: Required for compiling and executing the Java program.
- *Git & GitHub*: Version control and cloud repository for storing and sharing the project code.

## How It Works

When the user runs the program, a menu with four choices is displayed:

1. *Reserve a ticket*: The user is prompted to enter the necessary details. These details are then stored in an ArrayList as a comma-separated string.
2. *Cancel a ticket*: The user inputs the name under which the reservation was made. The application checks the list and removes the matching entry.
3. *View all reservations*: All stored records are split and displayed in a readable format.
4. *Exit*: Terminates the program.

The system operates in a continuous loop until the user decides to exit, making it convenient for handling multiple operations in a single session.

## Applicability

While this application is a basic model, the concept and functionality behind it are widely applicable. Systems like this are used in:

- *Railway Ticket Booking*
- *Bus and Flight Reservations*
- *Event Ticketing Systems*
- *Hotel Room Booking*
- *Appointment Scheduling Platforms*

This project demonstrates the core workflow of such systems and can be extended to support advanced features like user authentication, data persistence using files or databases, and graphical interfaces.

## Learning Outcomes

Working on this project helped me:

- Strengthen my understanding of Java basics including control structures, classes, and methods.
- Explore data structures like ArrayList and practice manipulating collections.
- Improve user input handling with the Scanner class.
- Understand real-world application structures and how console interfaces work.
- Gain experience in designing logic that simulates real-life services.
